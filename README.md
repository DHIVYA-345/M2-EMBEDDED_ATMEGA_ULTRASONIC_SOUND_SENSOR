# M2-EMBEDDED_PREPAID_ELECTRICITY_BILLING

                  The aim of the project is to minimize the queue at the energy meter billing counters and to restrict the usage of energy meter automatically, if the bill is not paid. The project also aims at proposing a system that will reduce the loss of power and revenue due to power thefts and other illegal activities. The work system adopts a totally new concept of "Prepaid Energy Meter". The GSM technology is used so that the consumer would receive messages about the consumption of power (in watts) and if it reaches the minimum amount, it would automatically alert the consumer to recharge. This technology holds good for all electricity distribution companies, private communities, IT parks and self-containing housing projects. The implementation of this project will help in better energy management, conservation of energy and also in doing away with the unnecessary hassles over incorrect billing. The automated billing system will keep track of the real time consumption and will leave little scope for disagreement on consumption and billing.
